  <VVE_Traveller_Blueprint.description>A basic road vehicle suited for flat terrain, the Traveller is a relatively cheap and fast option that still performs quite amicably in cold weather and snowy conditions. The light armour and exposed front-mounted engine leans to its cadence of running away from trouble rather than towards it.\n\nSimilar to other tier 1 vehicles, this is a gas guzzler and best used for medium distances. The extra speed and acceleration make it even less fuel-efficient as well as more time-consuming to repair.\n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Crew:&lt;/color&gt; Driver x1, Passenger x1\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Fuel type:&lt;/color&gt; Chemfuel</VVE_Traveller_Blueprint.description>
