  <VVE_Roadrunner_Blueprint.description>A general cargo transporter, the Roadrunner is an excellent vehicle for getting a lot of material from one location to another. Best suited on flat roads and will struggle somewhat on hills, snow or winter tiles.\n\nSimilar to other tier 2 vehicles, this has double fuel efficiency on the world map which makes them more efficient than tier 1 vehicles. They are also less visible due to improved manufacturing.\n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Crew:&lt;/color&gt; Driver x1, Passenger x1\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Fuel type:&lt;/color&gt; Chemfuel</VVE_Roadrunner_Blueprint.description>
