  <VVE_Roadkill_Blueprint.description>A basic medium tank, the Roadkill is a comparatively cheap armoured vehicle suited for short engagements. Very respectfully armoured from frontal attacks, however side attacks can disable movement and the exposed rear-mounted engine makes it vulnerable to flanking.\n\nWhile other tier 1 vehicles are gas guzzlers, this one burns through fuel at an alarming rate and is extremely slow to repair.\n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Crew:&lt;/color&gt; Driver x1\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Fuel type:&lt;/color&gt; Chemfuel</VVE_Roadkill_Blueprint.description>
