  <VVE_Highwayman_Blueprint.description>A basic infantry fighting vehicle, the Highwayman is the cheapest weaponized option for transporting three people. Hardened against small-arms fire but very vulnerable at the rear, intended to provide mobile fire support for infantry and travel quickly along paved roads.\n\nSimilar to other tier 1 vehicles, this is a gas guzzler and best used for medium distances, however it’s also less fuel efficient on the world map.\n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Crew:&lt;/color&gt; Driver x1, Gunner x1, Passenger x1\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Fuel type:&lt;/color&gt; Chemfuel</VVE_Highwayman_Blueprint.description>
