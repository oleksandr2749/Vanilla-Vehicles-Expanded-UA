  <VVE_Bunsen_Blueprint.description>A basic light tank, the Bunsen is a modified armoured vehicle suited for taking on enemy fortifications and exposed infantry. Special light plating to prevent self-immolation, combined with its main weapon drawing directly from its enlarged fuel tanks, leave it a very precarious model to field.\n\nSimilar to other tier 1 vehicles, this is a gas guzzler and best used for medium distances, however it’s also less fuel efficient on the world map.\n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Crew:&lt;/color&gt; Driver x1, Gunner x1\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Fuel type:&lt;/color&gt; Chemfuel</VVE_Bunsen_Blueprint.description>
