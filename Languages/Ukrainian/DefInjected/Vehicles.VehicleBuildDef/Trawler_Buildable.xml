  <VVE_Trawler_Blueprint.description>A general-purpose boat, the Trawler is an effective long distance transportation across open waters. Performs rather poorly on rivers and has to travel slowly during the winter season.\n\nSimilar to other tier 2 vehicles, this has double fuel efficiency on the world map which makes them more efficient than tier 1 vehicles. They are also less visible due to improved manufacturing.\n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Crew:&lt;/color&gt; Driver x1, Passenger x1\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Fuel type:&lt;/color&gt; Chemfuel</VVE_Trawler_Blueprint.description>
