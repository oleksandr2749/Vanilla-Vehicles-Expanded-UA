  <VVE_Scytheman_Blueprint.description>A juryrigged multiple rocket launcher system, the Scytheman is a repurposed farming vehicle intended to saturate a location with inaccurate volleys of explosives. Due to the design, it is not intended to fire successive volleys or be exposed to enemy fire.\n\nSimilar to other tier 1 vehicles, this is a gas guzzler and best used for medium distances. Performs worse in the winter but slightly better on the flat, open road.\n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Crew:&lt;/color&gt; Driver x1\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Fuel type:&lt;/color&gt; Chemfuel</VVE_Scytheman_Blueprint.description>
