  <VVE_Wagon_Blueprint.description>A general all-rounder vehicle, the Wagon performs well in all categories with a good cargo and passenger capacity. Best suited on flat roads and will struggle somewhat on hills, snow or winter tiles.\n\nSimilar to other tier 2 vehicles, this has double fuel efficiency on the world map which makes them more efficient than tier 1 vehicles. They are also less visible due to improved manufacturing.\n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Crew:&lt;/color&gt; Driver x1, Passenger x3\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Fuel type:&lt;/color&gt; Chemfuel</VVE_Wagon_Blueprint.description>
