  <VVE_Toad_Blueprint.description>A squad and mortar deployment pod, the Toad is a somewhat expensive vehicle to quickly mount a siege on a nearby locale without exposing your gunners to danger. With more armour than a tank and a design made to be deployed from orbit, it makes for a semi-disposable assault vehicle.\n\nFuel efficiency is not the design of this vehicle, consider only deploying on short distances with enough fuel to make it back.\n\nBeing a flying vehicle, it is extremely obvious when on the move.\n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Crew:&lt;/color&gt; Operator x1, Passenger x3\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Fuel type:&lt;/color&gt; Chemfuel</VVE_Toad_Blueprint.description>
