  <VVE_Prowler_Blueprint.description>A basic off-road exploration vehicle, the Prowler is relatively cheap to construct and is an effective all-weather option for efficient travel over steep terrain. Very lightly armoured with a vulnerable rear-mounted engine, it’s best to keep this single-user automobile away from combat.\n\nSimilar to other tier 1 vehicles, this is a gas guzzler and best used for medium distances.\n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Crew:&lt;/color&gt; Driver x1\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Fuel type:&lt;/color&gt; Chemfuel</VVE_Prowler_Blueprint.description>
