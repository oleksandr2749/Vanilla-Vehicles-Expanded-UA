  <VVE_Dinghy_Blueprint.description>A very basic motorised boat, the Dingy is an incredibly cheap and discrete method of transportation over water. Has a good cargo capacity, however it is likely to get frozen solid in the winter times and moves slowly on rivers. The exposed rear-mounted engine is vulnerable to attacks and the hull plating should not be expected to wither projectile weapons.\n\nSimilar to other tier 1 vehicles, this is a gas guzzler and best used for medium distances.\n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Crew:&lt;/color&gt; Driver x1, Passenger x5\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Fuel type:&lt;/color&gt; Chemfuel</VVE_Dinghy_Blueprint.description>
