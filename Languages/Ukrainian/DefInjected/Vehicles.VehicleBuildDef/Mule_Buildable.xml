  <VVE_Mule_Blueprint.description>A basic cargo transport, the Mule is a relatively cheap vehicle that can carry a large amount of cargo across smooth roads of flat terrain. Not recommended to use in the winter season or in snowy terrain, or both, and it is very lightly armoured to save weight.\n\nSimilar to other tier 1 vehicles, this is a gas guzzler and best used for medium distances. Unlike other tier 1 vehicles, this one performs better on the world map by being slightly faster and more fuel efficient.\n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Crew:&lt;/color&gt; Driver x1, Passenger x1\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Fuel type:&lt;/color&gt; Chemfuel</VVE_Mule_Blueprint.description>
