  <VVE_Dirtbike_Blueprint.description>A basic off-road motorcycle, the Dirtbike is a very cheap vehicle that allows a single user to travel quickly, efficiently and quietly. Incredibly light and practically paper-thin on armour, it performs poorly in the winter or in the snow, or both, and has absolutely no cargo capacity.\n\nSimilar to other tier 1 vehicles, this is a gas guzzler and best used for medium distances.\n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Crew:&lt;/color&gt; Driver x1\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Fuel type:&lt;/color&gt; Chemfuel</VVE_Dirtbike_Blueprint.description>
